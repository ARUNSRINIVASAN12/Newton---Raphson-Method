# Newton-Raphson Method 
This is an iterative method for finding successively better approximations to the roots (or zeroes) of a real-valued function.

In each iteration, the function values and their derivatives at the current guess are used to compute corrections ℎ and 𝑘. These corrections are then used to update the guess values for 𝑥 and 𝑦. This process repeats for the specified number of iterations, ideally converging to the roots of the equations.
